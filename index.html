						<h2>Trade Center</h2>

						<div class="slide">Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having the right frame of mind.
							The truth is, our thoughts are very powerful.
						</div>

							<div class="slideA">They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from our physical health
							to our social behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”

							If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the power
							of thought in a positive way has the ability to create great change in our lives, including our financial well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we take something as intangible as thoughts, and manifest them into a physical reality?
							We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money.
							Prosperity is a mindset, a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering this train of thought is not easy, but it is simple enough if we keep working on it consistently.
							Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more
							prosperity into your life
							Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to
							express heartfelt gratitude for the good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of these blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the right direction — on abundance, not lack.
							Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am”
							statements such as “I am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements down and repeat them nightly before bed. Over time, this will implant these thoughts into your subconscious mind, and you will begin to naturally believe them.
							Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you
							wish to achieve, and then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the
							same way affirmations do. Our subconscious will fill with images of prosperity, and
							eventually these subconscious “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as
							being prosperous, and you will become so.
							Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be
							one of your affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary,
							tell yourself you can earn more. Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and
							you will gain the confidence needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you could.
							If you believe you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks associated with people
							who are highly successful. Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher.
							Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like.
							Even if you can only afford to put a few dollars into your account every month, it will
							begin to build up and attract more money.
							Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such
							that we lend more power and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack
							will create more lack. Focusing on wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?
							Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day.
							But over time, with consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want.
							Once you master this power of thought, there are truly no limits to what you can create!

						<h3>International</h3>
						<h2>Commerce Centre</h2>

						<div class="slide">Successful businesses have many things in common, today we’ll look at the big ‘R’ of
							recognition and how a digital advertising network may help.
						</div>
						<div class="slideB">
							Recognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a crowded room at a party.
							Both walk to the far side of the room, one of them slips through the crowd easily and
							unnoticed as they reach the far side. The second person takes much longer to reach the
							far side because they are engaged in conversations along the way as they continue to meet
							acquaintances and friends during their path. Which type of person would you like to model
							your business after?
							Your business is in a continual battle for your customers’ recognition whether you know it
							or not. If you happen to be fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with very few
							competitors, that will not last for long. You need your business to be at the forefront of
							your client’s minds so that when they require your products or services, you are the go-to
							people.
							Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name and logo out there and keeping it
							there is a must. This lets clients know that you are “still around” and in business.
							Frequency is a good way to achieve the “stand out factor” in recognition. I am reminded of
							both television and radio ads I had heard of in the past. They run continually with a catch
							phrase or musical jingle over and over again on the radio or television until you are
							absolutely sick of hearing it. You also cannot get it out of your head. Although this type
							of advertising is expensive, it can be very effective, and the recognition factor is quite
							high. Television and radio can reach a large audience, and they are broad in their appeal.
							In a brief sentence, you are paying to market to both those that are your potential
							customers and a large segment of those who are not now and probably never will be your
							customers.
							There are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is to define your target
							market demographic, and invest your marketing funds into the locations that will best be
							seen by them.
							Another factor to consider is “can I market myself in a place where I will stand out from
							my competition, or where my competition does not have a presence?” Why would you market
							yourself in a flyer or newspaper right beside your competition and risk blending into a
							crowd, and ultimately being ignored?  Another issue to look at is diversification. As the
							saying goes, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you look at your advertising
							budget for the year, try to find the affordable solutions that will continue to reap during
							the full year of your advertising budget. An expensive radio or television promotion may
							give short term gains for that weekend sale, but what about the rest of the year? Your
							clients may end up with the impression of where did they go, I haven’t seen or heard
							anything about them for so long.
							Don’t always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep your eyes and ears open
							for the latest and greatest ways to market your business. With the costs of technology
							coming down dramatically new options such as digital advertising on LCD and Plasma screens
							are becoming more and more affordable, and the paper billboards and posters becoming a
							thing of the past. With the flexibility, and curb appeal of full color and motion video
							footage with computer generated graphics available to you, this is an option you don’t want
							to pass by without a good look. Ultimately, recognition is required if you want to get
							people “in the door” of your business (or on your website for the new e-businesses). This
							is going to cost you money, time and effort up front any way that you look at it, but if
							you have successfully reached your target market, the payoffs will be worth it.
